# âš¡ WELCOME TO PROJECT Z âš¡

## What is Project Zeus? 
#### A collection of python programs for a VFX studio to review. I just thought "Project Z" sounded cool, maybe Project Ultra would ahve been better.  

## What will you find? 
#### (3) different directories: 
	1. Infosec - A collection of tools I to learn more about python and a specirfic module I was interested
	2. russianLang - These is very much a minimum viable product program. I am writing this to help me learn Russian. ðŸ˜ˆ
	3. VFX - Programs I wrote for Houdini as an FX TD 

#### Inside the bash repo is a collection of programs to help me crawl networks, look at disk usage, etc.
