#### Two main repositories. 
	1)pyPrograms (python programs) üêç
	2)bash programs üëä 

## What's inside these repositories? 
#### Inside the pyPrograms repo is a collection of repositories. 
	1. Infosec - A collection of tools I to learn more about python and a specirfic module I was interested
	2. pyFoundations - A collection of programs I wrote/decomposed for my advanced python program course taken in Spring 2021
	3. russianLang - I'm weird and like to learn new things. I wrote this program to help me remember the Russian alphabet. It's very much a work in progress. I included because I wanted to share how I like to use a language like python to do different tasks taht are seemingling unlreated, except that I am trying to automate them üòà
	4. VFX - This is a collection of programs I wrote for FX TD workflows from a department perspective.
