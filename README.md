# âš¡ WELCOME TO PROJECT Z âš¡

## What is Project Z? 
#### A collection of python programs for a VFX studio to review. I just thought "Project Z" sounded cool, but not as cool as Project Ultra. However, this is not that type of project.   

## What will you find? 
#### (3) different directories: 
	1. Infosec - A collection of tools I wrote to learn more networks 
	2. russianLang - These is very much a minimum viable product program. I am writing this to help me learn Russian. ðŸ˜ˆ
	3. VFX - Programs I wrote for Houdini as an FX TD
